##Â GTD analysis

### Dashboard

Code for dashboard lives in the dashboard.py

requirements.txt lists all the required dependencies.

### Run locally

Once you have all the deps install you can run the dashboard using:

```bokeh serve --show dashboard.py```

It will open the dashboard in a browser window. Also hosted at: http://ec2-3-12-198-204.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:8000/dashboard for convinience.


### Analysis

I tried to analyse data mainly from three dimensions:


1. How terrorism shifted from one region to other over the years
2. How attack types and target types changed over the time
3. Economical impact of these attacks over the world.
